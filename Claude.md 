# TradingView InfluxDB POC Guidelines

## Persona-Based Task Assignment

The POC uses a persona-based approach for task assignment. When initiating a task, specify which persona should handle it by including one of the following tags in your prompt:

```
@SeniorDeveloper: [Task description]
```
or
```
@ProjectManager: [Task description]
```

### Available Personas

- **Senior Node.js Developer**: Technical implementation, code optimization, debugging, and architecture
**If you are a @SeniorDeveloper read this:**
  - [Detailed persona definition](/personas/senior_nodejs_developer.md)

- **Project Manager**: Documentation, task planning, progress tracking, and process coordination
**If you are a @ProjectManager read this:**  

  - [Detailed persona definition](/personas/project_manager.md)

If no persona is specified, Claude will determine the most appropriate persona based on the task description.
