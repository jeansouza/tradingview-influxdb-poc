## Current Status

The TradingView InfluxDB POC is currently in a functional state with all core features implemented. The application successfully demonstrates the integration of TradingView's charting library with InfluxDB for storing and visualizing time-series trading data.

The primary focus now is on validating the performance and scalability of the solution with large datasets, particularly for higher time resolutions where the current NoSQL solution struggles.

## Known Issues

1. **Query Timeouts**: Very large date ranges can cause query timeouts, though fallback strategies are in place
2. **Memory Usage**: Generating extremely large datasets (>10M records) requires high-memory mode
3. **Task Visibility**: Limited visibility into task execution details within InfluxDB
4. **TradingView Library**: Requires commercial license from TradingView (not included)
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Some advanced features may not work in older browsers

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Generate Large Test Dataset**: Create a dataset with 50M+ records for performance testing
2. **Run Comprehensive Tests**: Test query performance across different resolutions and date ranges
3. **Document Results**: Create detailed documentation of performance characteristics
4. **Compare with Current Solution**: Analyze performance compared to the current NoSQL solution
