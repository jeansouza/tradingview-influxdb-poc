# Project Brief: TradingView InfluxDB POC

## Overview
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) application that demonstrates the integration of TradingView's charting library with InfluxDB for storing and visualizing time-series trading data. It's built using Node.js, Express, and InfluxDB to validate the feasibility of implementing candlestick charts for cryptocurrency exchanges with InfluxDB as the data store.

## Problem Statement
Currently, a NoSQL-based solution is being used that precompiles trades by the second and dynamically aggregates them based on user-requested resolution. However, this approach performs poorly when handling higher time resolutions, especially with larger datasets. This POC aims to validate whether using InfluxDB with its native downsampling capabilities provides a more efficient solution.

## Core Requirements

1. **Data Storage & Management**
   - Store trading data in InfluxDB
   - Support for multiple trading symbols (BTCUSD, ETHUSD, LTCUSD)
   - Efficient downsampling of data for multiple time resolutions
   - Ability to handle millions of data points

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Integrate TradingView Charting Library
   - Display OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) candlestick charts
   - Support multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, etc.)
   - Custom date range selection

3. **API & Backend**
   - Node.js and Express backend
   - RESTful API endpoints for data access
   - Endpoints for generating test data
   - Efficient query mechanisms for large datasets

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Pre-downsampling of data for different resolutions
   - Batch processing for large datasets
   - Optimized InfluxDB queries
   - Memory-efficient data handling

5. **Incremental Downsampling**
   - **Critical Requirement**: Utilize InfluxDB's task mechanism to run downsampling incrementally
   - Start processing from scratch and then process a specific time window on each execution
   - Track progress to avoid reprocessing already downsampled data
   - Ensure tasks can handle both initial backfill and ongoing data processing

## Project Goals

1. **Validate Approach**: Determine if InfluxDB's downsampling capabilities provide better performance than the current NoSQL solution, especially for higher time resolutions.

2. **Demonstrate Scalability**: Show how InfluxDB can handle large volumes of time-series trading data efficiently.

3. **Showcase Integration**: Provide a working example of TradingView's charting library integration with a modern backend stack.

4. **Performance Testing**: Validate the performance characteristics of InfluxDB for trading data storage and retrieval.

5. **Reference Implementation**: Serve as a reference for developers looking to build similar trading data visualization systems.

## Technical Constraints

- TradingView Charting Library requires a license from TradingView
- System should be able to handle at least 50M+ records
- Support for modern browsers
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully store and retrieve millions of trade records
2. Render accurate OHLC charts with different timeframes
3. Demonstrate efficient downsampling for performance optimization using InfluxDB tasks
4. Show improved performance compared to the current NoSQL solution, especially for higher time resolutions
5. Implement incremental processing that can handle both initial data backfill and ongoing updates
6. Provide a responsive and intuitive user interface
7. Document the approach and implementation details
