# Product Context: TradingView InfluxDB POC

## Why This Project Exists

This project exists to solve a critical performance problem in cryptocurrency exchange data visualization. The current implementation uses a NoSQL-based solution that precompiles trades by the second and dynamically aggregates them based on user-requested resolution. While this approach works for lower time resolutions, it performs poorly when handling higher time resolutions (like hourly, daily, or weekly charts), especially with larger datasets.

The hypothesis is that InfluxDB, with its purpose-built time-series capabilities and native downsampling features, will provide a more efficient solution for storing and querying large volumes of trading data across multiple time resolutions.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Addresses the performance issues in the current NoSQL solution when dealing with higher time resolutions and large datasets.

2. **Data Aggregation Overhead**: Eliminates the need for on-the-fly aggregation by pre-downsampling data at various time resolutions (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d).

3. **Scalability Challenges**: Provides a more scalable approach to handle millions of trade records without degrading performance.

4. **Efficient Data Storage**: Optimizes storage and retrieval of time-series data using InfluxDB's specialized architecture.

5. **Incremental Processing**: Implements a solution for processing large historical datasets incrementally without overwhelming system resources.

## How It Should Work

### Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Trade data is ingested through API endpoints
   - Each trade contains symbol, price, amount, side, and timestamp
   - Data is written to InfluxDB in batches for efficiency

2. **Downsampling Process**:
   - InfluxDB tasks run on a schedule to downsample raw trade data
   - Tasks process data incrementally, tracking progress to avoid reprocessing
   - Pre-aggregated OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data is stored for each resolution
   - Resolutions include 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, and 1d

3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Frontend requests data for a specific symbol, time range, and resolution
   - Backend selects the appropriate pre-downsampled data based on the requested resolution
   - For very large date ranges, the system automatically selects a larger resolution
   - Data is returned in the format expected by the TradingView charting library

4. **Visualization**:
   - TradingView charting library renders OHLC candlestick charts
   - Users can switch between different symbols and timeframes
   - Custom date range selection allows for focused analysis

### Key Technical Aspects

1. **Incremental Processing**:
   - Each downsampling task checks if it's already running to prevent overlap
   - Tasks track the last processed timestamp and continue from there
   - Processing occurs in chunks (e.g., 1 day for 1m resolution, 90 days for 1d resolution)
   - Status tracking ensures reliable processing even if tasks are interrupted

2. **Resolution Mapping**:
   - The system maps user-requested resolutions to available downsampled data
   - For example, a 30m request might use 15m downsampled data
   - This mapping optimizes storage while still providing accurate visualization

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Large datasets are processed in batches to manage memory usage
   - Write operations use dedicated write APIs with appropriate buffer settings
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms ensure data integrity

## User Experience Goals

1. **Responsive Charts**: Users should experience fast-loading charts regardless of the selected time range or resolution.

2. **Intuitive Interface**: The interface should provide easy selection of symbols, timeframes, and custom date ranges.

3. **Accurate Visualization**: OHLC candlestick charts should accurately represent the trading data with proper open, high, low, and close values.

4. **Seamless Navigation**: Users should be able to navigate between different timeframes and date ranges without experiencing significant delays.

5. **Consistent Performance**: The system should maintain consistent performance even when dealing with millions of data points or extended time ranges.

## Target Users

1. **Cryptocurrency Exchange Developers**: Technical teams looking to implement efficient charting solutions for their trading platforms.

2. **Data Engineers**: Professionals interested in time-series data storage and processing patterns.

3. **Frontend Developers**: Developers working with financial charting libraries who need efficient backend solutions.

4. **Performance Engineers**: Engineers focused on optimizing data retrieval for time-series visualization.

## Success Metrics

1. **Query Performance**: Significant improvement in query response times compared to the current NoSQL solution, especially for higher time resolutions.

2. **Scalability**: Ability to handle 50M+ records without degradation in performance.

3. **Resource Efficiency**: Lower CPU and memory usage compared to the current solution.

4. **User Experience**: Smooth and responsive chart rendering with minimal loading times.

5. **Implementation Complexity**: Reasonable complexity in setup and maintenance compared to the benefits gained.
