# Active Context: TradingView InfluxDB POC

## Current Work Focus

The TradingView InfluxDB POC is currently in a functional state with all core features implemented. The project successfully demonstrates the integration of TradingView's charting library with InfluxDB for storing and visualizing time-series trading data.

The primary focus is on validating the performance and scalability of using InfluxDB with its native downsampling capabilities for cryptocurrency exchange data visualization, particularly for higher time resolutions where the current NoSQL solution struggles.

## Recent Changes

1. **Downsampling Task System**
   - Implemented InfluxDB tasks for incremental downsampling of trade data
   - Created task status tracking to prevent overlapping runs
   - Configured chunk-based processing for efficient memory usage
   - Added progress tracking to avoid reprocessing already downsampled data

2. **TradingView Integration**
   - Integrated TradingView Charting Library with custom datafeed
   - Implemented resolution mapping for optimal data retrieval
   - Added custom date range selection for focused analysis
   - Optimized data format conversion for TradingView compatibility

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented batch processing for large datasets
   - Added fallback strategies for query timeouts
   - Created adaptive resolution selection for large date ranges
   - Configured high-memory mode for generating large test datasets

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Created endpoints for trade data retrieval and creation
   - Implemented OHLC data endpoint with resolution mapping
   - Added test data generation endpoint with realistic price movement
   - Created symbol listing endpoint for frontend integration

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Conduct comprehensive performance testing with large datasets (50M+ records)
   - Compare query response times with the current NoSQL solution
   - Identify and address any performance bottlenecks
   - Document performance characteristics for different resolutions and date ranges

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Create detailed setup and configuration guide
   - Document the downsampling task system and its configuration
   - Add API documentation with examples
   - Create performance testing results and analysis

3. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Implement real-time data updates using WebSockets
   - Add more sophisticated error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Create administrative UI for monitoring downsampling tasks
   - Optimize memory usage for extremely large datasets

4. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Document production deployment best practices
   - Create Docker compose setup for easier deployment
   - Add monitoring and alerting recommendations
   - Document backup and recovery procedures

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Resolution Mapping Strategy

The current resolution mapping strategy maps user-requested resolutions to available downsampled data. This approach optimizes storage while providing accurate visualization. For example, a 30m request uses 15m downsampled data, and a 2h request uses 1h downsampled data.

**Considerations:**
- This approach reduces storage requirements by limiting the number of downsampled resolutions
- The trade-off is slightly less precise data for some resolutions
- Current mapping appears to provide good balance between storage and precision

### Incremental Processing Approach

The downsampling tasks process data incrementally, starting from scratch and then processing specific time windows on each execution. This approach allows for efficient processing of large historical datasets without overwhelming system resources.

**Considerations:**
- Chunk sizes are configured based on resolution (smaller chunks for higher resolutions)
- Progress tracking ensures reliable processing even if tasks are interrupted
- Task status tracking prevents overlapping runs
- Current implementation handles both initial backfill and ongoing data processing

### Query Optimization for Large Date Ranges

For very large date ranges, the system automatically selects a larger resolution to improve performance. This adaptive approach ensures reasonable response times even for queries spanning long time periods.

**Considerations:**
- Date range > 365 days: Force 1d resolution
- Date range > 90 days: Force 1h resolution for smaller requests
- Date range > 30 days: Force 15m resolution for 1m requests
- This approach significantly improves query performance for large date ranges
- The trade-off is reduced granularity for very large date ranges

### Memory Management for Large Datasets

The application implements several strategies to manage memory usage when dealing with large datasets, including batch processing, generator functions, and high-memory mode.

**Considerations:**
- Batch size of 100,000 trades for data generation
- Generator functions to create trades on-demand without storing large arrays
- Dedicated write APIs with appropriate buffer settings
- High-memory mode (8GB) available for generating very large datasets
